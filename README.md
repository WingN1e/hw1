In this programming assignment, I worked on two programs. The first one being called split, 
where it recursively split an array of integers into two different arrays based on whether
the numbers were even or odd. The second program was ULList, which allowed for an implementation
of an unrolled linked list, where each node had an array size of 10. We were asked to create
multiple functions that allowed me to remove and put in numbers into the array. Functions such asked
push_front, push_back, pop_front,and pop_back. Additionally, I also wrote back, front, and GetValAtLoc, 
which returned the address of the front index, back index, and value at a specific index.
